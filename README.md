# Hi there

This is my stash of the projects I do for fun or as university work.
I marked the latter by *-University-* tag.

## About me
My name is **Kirill**. I am currently a student at **[Voronezh State University](https://www.vsu.ru/en)**. Unemployed. I like doing interesting projects, but I particularly enjoy computer graphics or any field that requires scientific research in general.

### I speak
- 🇷🇺 **Russian** (native)
- 🇬🇧 **English**

### I code in
- **C++** - primarily
- **C** - enjoy but do not get to use often
- **C#** - mostly at university
- **Java**, **Python** - was taught at university but never used outside it

## How to contact me
I do not span many internet resources, so all I can offer aside from what is in the profile is my **[Discord](https://discordapp.com/users/353578395042578432)**
