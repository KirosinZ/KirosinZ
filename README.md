- 👋 Hi, I’m @KirosinZ
- 👀 I’m interested in programming all kinds of useless stuff for the sake of it.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C#, C++ and JS at university, but mainly use C# for my projects.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... something? Not sure my programming experience is sufficient to be helpful to anyone really.
- 📫 How to reach me: it's all in the profile.
