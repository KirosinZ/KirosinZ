- 👋 Hi, I’m @KirosinZ
- 👀 I’m interested in programming all kinds of useless stuff for the sake of it. My passion is 3D graphics though.
- 🌱 I mainly use C/C++ in my projects as they're my favorite languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything really.
- 📫 How to reach me: it's all in the profile.
